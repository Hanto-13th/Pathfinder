# Djikstra Algo's Implementation

**A project to implement the Djikstra algorithm in C language**

## ⚠️ Important Notes

⚠️ The data struct used is not the better for the time complexity >> O(N²) vs O(N² log N)
⚠️ Just change in a min heap struct to have optimal time complexity

### ✨ Features

1. Visualization of the algo on the CLI in ASCII.

2. Possibilities for the user to choose the size of the matrice.

3. Possibilities for the user to choose the start and the target nodes.

4. The matrice is composed with N x N nodes

5. The start node is represented with 'A', the target node with 'B' and the other node with '#'

6. The algo displays the number of nodes from the started node to the target

#### 🚀 Installation

**Clone the repository:**

`git clone https://github.com/Hanto-13th/Pathfinder.git`
`cd Pathfinder`


**Compil the program:**

`gcc src/*.c -Iinclude -Wall -Wextra -lm -o main.exe`


**Launch it:**

`./main.exe`


##### ▶️ Usage

1. Launch the program and enter the start and the target nodes ID you want (ID are the slot index of the matrice e.g: matrice size = n possible ID = {0,...,n-1})

2. The program compute automatically

3. Watch the results

4. Modify the matrice size as you want
